Bio
======
Shipei Zeng is a Research Scientist at the [Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data](https://www.sribd.cn/), holding BEcon and MEcon degrees from Renmin University of China and a Ph.D. in Economics from UNSW Sydney. His research spans the digital economy, economic statistics, and computational social science. He is the author of "[dfvad](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dfvad/index.html)", an open-source R tool for economic measurement indexes officially approved by CRAN. His work is widely recognized, with publications in journals such as *Journal of Forecasting*, *Computational Economics*, and *Information and Software Technology*, alongside patents for digital algorithms. He actively leads or contributes to major projects funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Jiangsu Provincial Research Base, and other agencies. He also serves as an Adjunct Scholar at [CUHK-Shenzhen](https://hss.cuhk.edu.cn/page/1350), advancing research in computational social science. Beyond academia, he applies AI methods—such as AIGC evaluation, explainable AI, and ensemble learning—to both public sector initiatives (including public services, talent development, and tech innovation) and industry projects across finance, energy, and telecommunications, bridging research with practical impact.

His innovations have achieved substantial real world adoption. The data-driven "dfvad" tool has been downloaded over 18,000 times and is used by statistical agencies and universities worldwide to analyze economic growth and productivity. His proposed techniques involved with explainable AI and data mining in patent documents provide targeted solutions for scenarios such as financial analysis, anti fraud verification, and project evaluation. Initiatives including public affairs LLM evaluation, digital talent survey, and digital finance strategy have delivered actionable consulting and technology solutions, earning formal recognition from government bodies and integration into the decision making processes of leading corporate partners.

曾诗培，[深圳市大数据研究院](https://www.sribd.cn/)人工智能大模型中心研究科学家。中国人民大学经济学学士、硕士，澳大利亚新南威尔士大学经济学博士。主要研究领域为数字经济、经济统计、计算社会科学。开发经济测度指数方法R语言开源工具“[dfvad](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dfvad/index.html)”（CRAN官方收录）。在相关领域国际主流期刊（包括*Journal of Forecasting*、*Computational Economics*、*Information and Software Technology*等）发表论文多篇；多项数字化算法技术获国家发明专利。作为负责人或主要参与人承担国家、省、市级科研项目，包括国家自然科学基金项目、江苏省决策咨询研究基地课题。兼任[香港中文大学（深圳）人文社科学院](https://hss.cuhk.edu.cn/page/1350)客座学者，开展计算社会科学研究。推动生成式AI评测、可解释AI、集成学习等技术成果在政务领域（如政数、人才、科创），以及金融、能源、通信企业项目中的转化应用。

核心成果已形成明确落地实践价值：R语言包 “dfvad” 融入数据驱动的经济测度逻辑，在统计局、高校等机构人员中广泛使用，用户下载量18,000+，成为经济增长与生产率实用分析工具；多项专利所涉技术融合可解释AI与数据挖掘能力，为企业财务智能分析、反诈核验与信用评价、科研项目辅助验收等场景提供支持；主导的政务大模型测评、数字人才调研、数字金融机器学习优化策略等工作，输出咨询方案与数字技术，既获政务部门认可，也被大型合作企业的决策采纳，助力技术服务于政务与产业实践。
