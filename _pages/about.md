Bio
======
Shipei Zeng is a Research Scientist at the AIM Center of [Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data](https://www.sribd.cn/), holding BEcon and MEcon degrees from Renmin University of China and an Econ Ph.D. from the University of New South Wales. His research centers on the digital economy, economic statistics, and computational social science. He developed "[dfvad](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dfvad/index.html)", an open-source R tool for economic measurement index methods officially approved by CRAN. His work is widely recognized, with publications in journals such as *Journal of Forecasting*, *Computational Economics*, and *Information and Software Technology*, and he holds multiple national invention patents for innovative digital algorithms. Active in research, he leads or contributes to national, provincial, and municipal projects, including initiatives funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Jiangsu Provincial Decision-Making Consultation Research Base. He also serves as an Adjunct Scholar at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://hss.cuhk.edu.cn/page/1350), where he researches computational social science. Beyond academia, he applies technologies like generative AI evaluation, explainable AI, and ensemble learning in government sectors (e.g., public services, talent development, tech innovation) and corporate projects across finance, energy, and telecommunications, bridging research and real-world practice.

曾诗培，[深圳市大数据研究院](https://www.sribd.cn/)AIM中心研究科学家。中国人民大学经济学学士、硕士，澳大利亚新南威尔士大学经济学博士。主要研究领域为数字经济、经济统计、计算社会科学。开发经济测度指数方法R语言开源工具“[dfvad](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dfvad/index.html)”（CRAN官方收录）。在相关领域国际主流期刊（包括*Journal of Forecasting*、*Computational Economics*、*Information and Software Technology*等）发表论文多篇；多项数字化算法技术获国家发明专利。作为负责人或主要参与人承担国家、省、市级科研项目，包括国家自然科学基金项目、江苏省决策咨询研究基地课题。兼任[香港中文大学（深圳）人文社科学院](https://hss.cuhk.edu.cn/page/1350)客座学者，开展计算社会科学研究。推动生成式AI评测、可解释AI、集成学习等技术成果在政务领域（如政数、人才、科创），以及金融、能源、通信企业项目中的转化应用。

Coding
------
[DFVAD R Package](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dfvad/index.html): This R computing package, which I am the author of, helps to identify the main drivers of productivity and economic growth. It has been officially approved by CRAN and is utilized by researchers interested in economic growth studies, with **18,000+** downloads. Value added growth can be broken down into explanatory elements using the R coding tools it offers. The production frontier is specified using a cost constrained value added function. A weighted average method can also be used to aggregate industry estimations. Details about the methodology and data can be found in [Diewert and Fox (2018)](https://academic.oup.com/edited-volume/41719/chapter-abstract/354003191?redirectedFrom=fulltext) and [Zeng, Parsons, Diewert and Fox (2018)](https://conference.unsw.edu.au/content/dam/pdfs/business/caer/research-reports/emg-workshop-2018/emg2018-6_SZeng_EMG-Slides.pdf).
