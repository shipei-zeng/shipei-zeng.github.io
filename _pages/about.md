Bio
======
Shipei Zeng is a Research Scientist at the [Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data](https://www.sribd.cn/), holding BEcon and MEcon degrees from Renmin University of China and a Ph.D. in Economics from UNSW Sydney. His research spans the digital economy, economic statistics, and computational social science. He is the author of "[dfvad](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dfvad/index.html)", an open-source R tool for economic measurement indexes officially approved by CRAN. His work is widely recognized, with publications in journals such as *Journal of Forecasting*, *Computational Economics*, and *Information and Software Technology*, alongside patents for digital algorithms. He actively leads or contributes to major projects funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Jiangsu Provincial Research Base, and other agencies. He also serves as an Adjunct Scholar at [CUHK-Shenzhen](https://hss.cuhk.edu.cn/page/1350), advancing research in computational social science. Beyond academia, he applies AI methods—such as AIGC evaluation, explainable AI, and ensemble learning—to both public sector initiatives (including public services, talent development, and tech innovation) and industry projects across finance, energy, and telecommunications, bridging research with practical impact.

His AI driven innovations have achieved substantial real world adoption. The "dfvad" tool has been downloaded over 18,000 times and is used by statistical agencies and universities worldwide to analyze economic growth and productivity. His proposed techniques in patent documents provide targeted solutions for scenarios such as financial analysis, anti fraud verification, and project evaluation. Initiatives including public affairs LLM evaluation, digital talent survey, and digital finance strategy have delivered actionable technology and consulting solutions, earning formal recognition from government bodies and integration into the decision making processes of leading corporate partners.
